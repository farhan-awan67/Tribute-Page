          <h2>A.Q Khan</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b> was born on 1 April 1936, in Bhopal, a city
            then in the erstwhile British Indian princely state of Bhopal State,
            and now the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. He was a Muhajir of
            Urdu-speaking Pashtun origin.[14][15][2][5][16] His father, Abdul
            Ghafoor, was a schoolteacher who once worked for the Ministry of
            Education, and his mother, Zulekha, was a housewife with a very
            religious mindset.[17] His older siblings, along with other family
            members, had emigrated to Pakistan during the partition of India in
            1947, who would often write to Khan's parents about the new life
            they had found in Pakistan.[18] After his matriculation from a local
            school in Bhopal, in 1952 Khan emigrated from India to Pakistan on
            the Sind Mail train, partly due to the reservation
            politics[19]: 254  at that time, and religious violence in India
            during his youth had left an indelible impression on his world
            view.[20] Upon settling in Karachi with his family, Khan briefly
            attended the D. J. Science College before transferring to the
            University of Karachi, where he graduated in 1956 with a Bachelor of
            Science (BSc) in physics with a concentration on solid-state
            physics.
